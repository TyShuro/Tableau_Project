## Project/Goals
Project Description:
Title: Analyzing Global Mortality: Insights from the 'Causes of Death' Data

Overview:
This project delves into the comprehensive 'Causes of Death' dataset, sourced from Our World In Data and based on the Global Burden of Disease study published in The Lancet. The dataset encompasses detailed records of mortality causes across various countries and regions. Through this project, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in global mortality data, exploring the predominant causes of death worldwide and their variations across different geographies and over time.

Project Goals:
1. Data Understanding and Exploration:

Thoroughly examine the dataset to understand its structure, content, and the nature of the data.
Identify key features that are crucial for analyzing mortality trends.

2. Visualization and Analysis:

Create a series of intuitive and interactive visualizations that offer clear insights into the data.
Visualizations should include geographical mappings, time-series analyses, comparative studies across countries, and advanced analytical charts like forecasts and clustering.

3. Pattern Identification:

Detect significant patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. This includes identifying leading causes of death globally, changes over time, and country-specific mortality profiles.

4. Comparative Analysis:

Conduct a comparative analysis to understand how different regions and countries vary in terms of mortality causes.
Explore any socio-economic or geographical correlations with the observed mortality patterns.

## Process

1. Data Acquisition
Source: The dataset was downloaded from the 'Our World in Data' website, specifically the 'Causes of Death' data.
Content: This dataset provides comprehensive information on various causes of death across different countries and regions.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Removing Duplicate Categories: Identified and removed duplicate entries where 'America' and 'USA' were overlapping.
Eliminating Empty Rows: Deleted rows that contained no information in the 'Death Numbers' column to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
Data Validation: Checked the dataset for any other inconsistencies or issues that might affect the analysis.
3. Data Connection in Tableau Public
Importing Data: Connected the cleaned dataset to Tableau Public for visualization and analysis.
Data Type Verification: Ensured that Tableau correctly identified data types for each column after import.
4. Visualization and Analysis in Tableau
Global Heat Map:

Objective: To visualize the geographical distribution of various causes of death.
Approach: Utilized geographical mapping features in Tableau to create a heat map, highlighting regions based on mortality rates from different causes.
Time Series Analysis of Death Causes:

Objective: To analyze trends in causes of death over time.
Visualization: Created line graphs to represent the temporal trends in mortality due to various causes.
Comparative Cause of Death Analysis by Country:

Objective: To compare how different countries fare in terms of various causes of death.
Features: Incorporated a filter for causes of death, allowing for a dynamic comparison across different nations.
Visualization: Employed comparative bar charts or similar visuals to showcase this comparison.
Mortality Rate Pie Chart:

Objective: To display the proportional breakdown of different causes of death within individual countries.
Visualization: Constructed pie charts to represent the mortality rate distribution per cause within selected countries.
Tree Map of Global Death Proportions:

Objective: To provide a global overview of death proportions by cause.
Visualization: Created a tree map to depict the part-to-whole relationships of various causes of death globally.
5. Dashboard Creation
Integration: Combined all individual visualizations into a coherent and interactive Tableau dashboard.
Interactivity and Design: Ensured the dashboard was user-friendly, with interactive elements like filters and drill-down options for deeper analysis.

## Results
Option Chosen:
Option 2
Dataset Selected:
Dataset Name: Causes of Death - Our World In Data
Source: Our World in Data, based on the Global Burden of Disease study published in The Lancet.
Content Description: The dataset includes comprehensive records of various causes of death across countries and regions for the year 2017.
Data Question:
Primary Question: What are the leading causes of death globally, how do they vary across different countries, and what trends can be observed over time?
Objective: To identify and analyze global mortality patterns, understand regional differences, and uncover temporal trends in causes of death.
Visualizations Created and Rationale:
Global Heat Map

Purpose: To visually represent the geographical distribution of various causes of death.
Why: This visualization allows for a quick, intuitive understanding of how different causes of death are distributed around the world, highlighting regions with higher mortality rates for specific causes.
Time Series Analysis of Death Causes

Purpose: To explore trends in causes of death over time.
Why: Time series analysis is crucial to understand whether certain causes of death are increasing or decreasing globally, indicating shifts in global health trends.
Comparative Cause of Death Analysis by Country

Purpose: To compare the prevalence of different causes of death across countries.
Why: This comparative view provides insights into country-specific health challenges and allows for the identification of unique mortality profiles.
Mortality Rate Pie Chart

Purpose: To show the proportional distribution of causes of death within individual countries.
Why: Pie charts effectively communicate part-to-whole relationships, making it easier to understand the dominant causes of death in a specific country.
Tree Map of Global Death Proportions

Purpose: To provide a summarized view of global mortality by cause.
Why: Tree maps are excellent for displaying hierarchical data and visually depicting how different causes contribute to global mortality.

## Challenges 
Data Complexity and Volume:
Handling and making sense of a vast, multi-faceted dataset

Data Cleaning and Integrity: 
Ensuring accuracy by meticulously cleaning and validating data (e.g., resolving duplicates, handling missing values).

## Future Goals
Incorporating Additional Data: Plans to integrate more datasets, such as socio-economic factors, healthcare access, and lifestyle choices, for a more comprehensive analysis.
Predictive Modeling: Future goal to use the data for predictive modeling to forecast trends in global health and mortality.
Collaboration and Sharing: Aspirations to collaborate with public health experts and policymakers, sharing insights for informed decision-making.
