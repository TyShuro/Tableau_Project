## Project/Goals
Project Description:
Title: Analyzing Global Mortality: Insights from the 'Causes of Death' Data

Overview:
This project delves into the comprehensive 'Causes of Death' dataset, sourced from Our World In Data and based on the Global Burden of Disease study published in The Lancet. The dataset encompasses detailed records of mortality causes across various countries and regions. Through this project, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in global mortality data, exploring the predominant causes of death worldwide and their variations across different geographies and over time.

Project Goals:
1. Data Understanding and Exploration:

Thoroughly examine the dataset to understand its structure, content, and the nature of the data.
Identify key features that are crucial for analyzing mortality trends.

2. Visualization and Analysis:

Create a series of intuitive and interactive visualizations that offer clear insights into the data.
Visualizations should include geographical mappings, time-series analyses, comparative studies across countries, and advanced analytical charts like forecasts and clustering.

3. Pattern Identification:

Detect significant patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. This includes identifying leading causes of death globally, changes over time, and country-specific mortality profiles.

4. Comparative Analysis:

Conduct a comparative analysis to understand how different regions and countries vary in terms of mortality causes.
Explore any socio-economic or geographical correlations with the observed mortality patterns.
